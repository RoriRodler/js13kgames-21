# Invitation
An unfinished entry for js13kGames 2021  

The builder is based on the build.js in Triska Reloaded https://github.com/js13kGames/Triska , made by @remvst https://github.com/remvst .  
After building the game, you can serve it with  
```npm run serve```

## Controls
Left and right arrow keys for moving, E for using the workstation.  
(The game is unfinished, so the "use" action can be fired from anywhere and it always succeeds.)  
## The goal
The goal of the game would had been to keep the signal strength for a given time by using the workstation.  
Losing the signal would result in a failed mission, keeping the signal strength long enough would send the player to the next level.  
With each level the scenery in the navigation monitor changes. We start from a place in space and end up in front of planet Earth.  
On success, the alien meets the human who sent the invitation :)
